    <p class="text">The country you live in is a dictatorship called Chintawa. There is a zero tolerance against crime or disruption of the order. If you’re caught doing one of those you will be hang util death. 
        In this country, an unknown virus has appeared. Nobody knows where it comes from and how to treat it. So, the Chintawa’s Government has established a total lockdown of an unknown duration. Nobody can leave his house. 
        Your goal is to survive this lockdown by any means. To do so, you will have managed your money, your hygiene, and your mental health. If one of those stats reaches zero you will lose.
        Each day you will choose an action that you want to make. This action will affect your stats bar. There are two types of action: basic action and ability related action.
    </p>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>Basic actions are action that you will be able to do from the beginning of the game until the end.</li>
        <li>Ability related actions are action or passive skill that you will obtain by upgrading your abilities such as Social Interaction, Computer Science, Tai Chi, Stealth, Worker.</li>
